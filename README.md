#### About this repo

- This repo contains interface to downstream NLP applications, as well as the implementations of them (which can either 
be a copy from respective author repositories or extensions to such a copy or totally  written from scratch). 
- The main purpose of this repo is to save time for current and future graduate students who work on areas related to 
NLP as it can help in performance testing of their upstream models. Also, as this repo is maintained by multiple students, 
there can be a higher chances of the code being bug-free. 

#### Some advise to the contributors

- Jupyter notebooks are highly discouraged. We strictly discourage commiting any of such notebooks into this repository. 
Also, we softly discourage the usage of it for upstream experimentations (except for the case of Google Colab). If you
disagree on our advise, we suggest you to read this [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d2DSmPY0dkr4jhD5aTfwdoBZEON_AQNp7w2Nr9mM7GU/edit?usp=sharing)
